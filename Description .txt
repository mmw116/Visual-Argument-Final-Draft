For my visual argument I wanted to show the idea that we lose touch with our inner child when we transition into reality and adult life. To show this I used an adult businessman holding a briefcase on the right and a young girl holding a backpack on the left. I wanted the contrast to be clear with the adult/reality side being more ridged and using hard edges on the images as well as making it dark. And on the child’s side I used brighter images and made them softer and airy to show the innocence and dreaminess that we have as children. To emphasize these opposites I used a white vignette on the girls side and a black vignette on the mans side. I chose to make the girls side have more space (negative and used space) to show the freedom a child feels to dream and do what they want and not having any responsibilities. Likewise I made the man’s side more crammed and closed of to show lack of freedom and to make his side feel tighter and more constrained. In my visual argument the man is looking down at the child envying her freedom, he wants to give her the bag but she is off in her own little world being herself and doing her own things. She is not paying attention to the man because she is content with her own world and too carefree to notice. I decided to include bubbles between them and have them even touch the man to further show that there is a block between them and their thinking. The bubbles are almost like a shield.
